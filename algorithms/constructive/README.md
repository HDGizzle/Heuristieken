Depth First Algorithm
=====================

For the Radio Russia problem, we used the Depth First algorithm. This algorithm searches the graph systematically and ensuring to search every province or state. For this assignment, states, oblasts and provinces are seen as nodes of an undirected graph. This is done by keeping track of a visited set and a stack. When all nodes are visited, they should be present in the visited list. This ensures that every province or state has been visited. The stack is created to track the nodes of the graph and is used to hold visited vertices.

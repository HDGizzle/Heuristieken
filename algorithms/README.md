For the heuristic problem concerning the Radio Russia problem, we used three different types of algortihms, each pleaced in a seperate file.

1. Welsh Powell algortihm  -  greedy algorithm
2. Depth First algorithm   -  iterative algorithm
3. Hill Climber algortihm  -  constructive algorithm 

Each algortihm type is more thorougly explained in the according folders
